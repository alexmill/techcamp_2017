# Exercises 7: Text Processing

Use the full movies dataset covered in the lecture (Notebook linked here). Some useful exercises are provided below:

- Find the number of total words and unique words used in each of the movies. Which movie summary has the largest vocabulary?
- Pick a movie from the list (suggestions: "The Godfather" or "Lord of the Rings").
  - Find the top words (excluding stopwords!) in your chosen movie
  - Find the most similar movie (using cosine similarity) to your chosen movie (among the full set of 90 movies)

I encourage you to copy/paste/write your code in steps, and make sure you understand what is being accomplished at each step.
